 (1,'<p>Toys for Shots is an annual fundraiser/holiday party. The primary purpose of this very special event is to collect as many new, un-giftwrapped toys as we can for the Marine\'s Toys for Tots program. A couple of representatives from the Marines will be present at the event to collect all the donated toys. In keeping with the true spirit of the holidays, your gift of a toy(s) can spread so much joy and hope to a deserving Cleveland area child this Christmas. Last year we were able to collect 16 huge boxes of toys and hope to break that record this year! The Marine\'s will be prepared with a large truck this year to fit all the toys we expect to donate!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why the name, \"Toys for Shots\"? We thought it would entice folks to go out and buy a toy if we offered a free drink in return for their toy (1 toy for 1 shot...\"Toys for Shots\"). The idea worked and we are happy to offer it again this year. Bring at least one new, un-giftwrapped toy and we will give you a free drink ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although our purpose is to provide a bit of holiday happiness to children in need, this event is a holiday party! Expect to dance and have a good time, mingle with the crowd, have some holiday cheer, enjoy the food and participate in the raffle. We have an awesome lineup of baskets and items to be raffled off this year, so be sure to bring a few extra bucks to purchase the chinese raffle tickets!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will mark the fifth year for this event and we have some very high expectations. The event itself has grown each year in donations, gifts and attendance. This year the planning committee is made up of more than twenty people. Not only are we planning on delivering the best Toys for Shots event yet, but we expect this to grow into one of Northeast Ohio\'s biggest toy drives. We hope you will join us for an amazing night on December 08, 2012.</p>\r\n','initial commit',1,'2013-09-21 19:02:17',0x00,1,1),

The event will be held in the river room which is located on the second floor at the far end of the building. After you park and you are walking towards the building you will see a red awning. This is the entrance to the river room and at that point you should see signs for the event. This will be a private event, please <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'rsvp\')#\">RSVP</a> so we have a accurate guest list and an idea of how many people are coming. If you bring a toy or check we will give you 2 drink tickets. This will hopefully encourage everyone to <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">bring a donation</a> to this wonderful cause. If you don\'t bring a toy there will be a $10.00 donation cover charge.</p>\r\n<strong>Chinese Auction</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between a raffle and a Chinese auction is that in a raffle with multiple prizes, there is one \"hat\" from which names are drawn, but in a Chinese auction each prize has its own \"hat\". This allows ticket buyers to choose which prize to focus on, as opposed to having a first, second, third, etc. prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">raffle prize donations</a> to help make this event a smash. We have some ideas for raffle baskets but if you have ideas please let us know. You can find out what raffle prizes have already been donated by <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'raffle\')#\">visiting the raffle page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>The private party room will have a DJ making it impossible to be bored.</p>\r\n<strong>Dancers</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>Rock City Dance Studio will be performing a special dance routine choreographed by Jayj Graham.<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rockcitydance.com\">www.rockcitydance.com</a></p>\r\n<strong>Photo Booth &amp; Photographer</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>&nbsp;\r\n<p>We will have a photo booth for you to take pictures with your friends.

 (15,'<p><strong>Who:</strong> Everyone is Welcome!<br />\r\n<strong>What:</strong> Toys for Shots Fundraiser/Holiday Party<br />\r\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> To raise funds and boxes of toys for the Marine\'s Toys for Tots Program<br />\r\n<strong>Food:</strong> Finger foods from Windows on the River and Cheesecakes plus other goodies from Marry Me Cheesecakes will be served at no charge<br />\r\n<strong>Drink:</strong> Cash Bar<br />\r\n<strong>What to Wear:</strong> It\'s a holiday party! Dress to impress!<br />\r\n<strong>Where:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toys for Shots is an annual fundraiser/holiday party. The primary purpose of this very special event is to collect as many new, un-giftwrapped toys as we can for the Marine\'s Toys for Tots program. A couple of representatives from the Marines will be present at the event to collect all the donated toys. In keeping with the true spirit of the holidays, your gift of a toy(s) can spread so much joy and hope to a deserving Cleveland area child this Christmas. Last year we were able to collect 16 huge boxes of toys and hope to break that record this year! The Marine\'s will be prepared with a large truck this year to fit all the toys we expect to donate!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why the name, \"Toys for Shots\"? We thought it would entice folks to go out and buy a toy if we offered a free drink in return for their toy (1 toy for 1 shot...\"Toys for Shots\"). The idea worked and we are happy to offer it again this year. Bring at least one new, un-giftwrapped toy and we will give you a free drink ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although our purpose is to provide a bit of holiday happiness to children in need, this event is a holiday party! Expect to dance and have a good time, mingle with the crowd, have some holiday cheer, enjoy the food and participate in the raffle. We have an awesome lineup of baskets and items to be raffled off this year, so be sure to bring a few extra bucks to purchase the chinese raffle tickets!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will mark the fifth year for this event and we have some very high expectations. The event itself has grown each year in donations, gifts and attendance. This year the planning committee is made up of more than twenty people. Not only are we planning on delivering the best Toys for Shots event yet, but we expect this to grow into one of Northeast Ohio\'s biggest toy drives.

The event will be held in the river room which is located on the second floor at the far end of the building. After you park and you are walking towards the building you will see a red awning. This is the entrance to the river room and at that point you should see signs for the event. This will be a private event, please <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'rsvp\')#\">RSVP</a> so we have a accurate guest list and an idea of how many people are coming. If you bring a toy or check we will give you 2 drink tickets. This will hopefully encourage everyone to <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">bring a donation</a> to this wonderful cause. If you don\'t bring a toy there will be a $10.00 donation cover charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chinese Auction</strong></p>\r\n<p>The difference between a raffle and a Chinese auction is that in a raffle with multiple prizes, there is one \"hat\" from which names are drawn, but in a Chinese auction each prize has its own \"hat\". This allows ticket buyers to choose which prize to focus on, as opposed to having a first, second, third, etc. prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">raffle prize donations</a> to help make this event a smash. We have some ideas for raffle baskets but if you have ideas please let us know. You can find out what raffle prizes have already been donated by <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'raffle\')#\">visiting the raffle page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The private party room will have a DJ making it impossible to be bored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Photo Booth &amp; Photographer</strong></p>\r\n<p>We will have a photo booth for you to take pictures with your friends. We will also have a photographer walking around the event capturing everything.</p>','',6,'2013-09-21 21:19:11',0x00,1,2),

 (35,'<p><strong>Who:</strong> Everyone is Welcome!<br />\r\n<strong>What:</strong> Toys for Shots Fundraiser/Holiday Party<br />\r\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> To raise funds and boxes of toys for the Marine\'s Toys for Tots Program<br />\r\n<strong>Food:</strong> Finger foods from Windows on the River and Cheesecakes plus other goodies from Marry Me Cheesecakes will be served at no charge<br />\r\n<strong>Drink:</strong> Cash Bar<br />\r\n<strong>What to Wear:</strong> It\'s a holiday party! Dress to impress!<br />\r\n<strong>Where:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toys for Shots is an annual fundraiser/holiday party. The primary purpose of this very special event is to collect as many new, un-giftwrapped toys as we can for the Marine\'s Toys for Tots program. A couple of representatives from the Marines will be present at the event to collect all the donated toys. In keeping with the true spirit of the holidays, your gift of a toy(s) can spread so much joy and hope to a deserving Cleveland area child this Christmas. Last year we were able to collect 16 huge boxes of toys and hope to break that record this year! The Marine\'s will be prepared with a large truck this year to fit all the toys we expect to donate!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why the name, \"Toys for Shots\"? We thought it would entice folks to go out and buy a toy if we offered a free drink in return for their toy (1 toy for 1 shot...\"Toys for Shots\"). The idea worked and we are happy to offer it again this year. Bring at least one new, un-giftwrapped toy and we will give you a free drink ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although our purpose is to provide a bit of holiday happiness to children in need, this event is a holiday party! Expect to dance and have a good time, mingle with the crowd, have some holiday cheer, enjoy the food and participate in the raffle. We have an awesome lineup of baskets and items to be raffled off this year, so be sure to bring a few extra bucks to purchase the chinese raffle tickets!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will mark the fifth year for this event and we have some very high expectations. The event itself has grown each year in donations, gifts and attendance. This year the planning committee is made up of more than twenty people. Not only are we planning on delivering the best Toys for Shots event yet, but we expect this to grow into one of Northeast Ohio\'s biggest toy drives. We hope you will join us for an amazing night on December 08, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank You</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\">Daniel Vega</div>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nToys for Shots Founder</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','',9,'2013-09-21 22:21:50',0x00,1,1),

The event will be held in the river room which is located on the second floor at the far end of the building. After you park and you are walking towards the building you will see a red awning. This is the entrance to the river room and at that point you should see signs for the event. This will be a private event, please <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'rsvp\')#\">RSVP</a> so we have a accurate guest list and an idea of how many people are coming. If you bring a toy or check we will give you 2 drink tickets. This will hopefully encourage everyone to <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">bring a donation</a> to this wonderful cause. If you don\'t bring a toy there will be a $10.00 donation cover charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chinese Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between a raffle and a Chinese auction is that in a raffle with multiple prizes, there is one \"hat\" from which names are drawn, but in a Chinese auction each prize has its own \"hat\". This allows ticket buyers to choose which prize to focus on, as opposed to having a first, second, third, etc. prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'donate\')#\">raffle prize donations</a> to help make this event a smash. We have some ideas for raffle baskets but if you have ideas please let us know. You can find out what raffle prizes have already been donated by <a href=\"#event.buildLink(\'raffle\')#\">visiting the raffle page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private party room will have a DJ making it impossible to be bored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Photo Booth &amp; Photographer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will have a photo booth for you to take pictures with your friends.
